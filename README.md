{rgeedim} supports search and download of Google Earth Engine imagery
with Python module
[`geedim`](https://github.com/leftfield-geospatial/geedim) by Dugal
Harris. This package provides wrapper functions that make it more
convenient to use `geedim` from R.

The [rgeedim manual](https://humus.rocks/rgeedim/) describes the R API.
See the [geedim manual](https://geedim.readthedocs.io/) for more
information on Python API and command line interface.

Using `geedim`, images larger than the [`Image.getDownloadURL()` size
limit](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-image-getdownloadurl)
are split and downloaded as separate tiles, then re-assembled into a
single GeoTIFF.

## Installation

{rgeedim} is available on CRAN, and can be installed as follows:

``` r
install.packages("rgeedim")
```

You can install the development version of {rgeedim} using {remotes}:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("brownag/rgeedim")
```

## Dependencies

You will need Python 3 with the `geedim` module installed to use
{rgeedim}.

#### Using `gd_install()`

`gd_install()` provides a simple wrapper around
`reticulate::py_install()` that allows you to install dependencies using
`pip`, virtual, or Conda environments.

``` r
# install with pip (with reticulate)
gd_install()

# install with pip (system() call)
gd_install(system = TRUE)

# use virtual environment with default name "r-reticulate"
gd_install(method = "virtualenv")

# use "conda" environment named "foo"
gd_install(method = "conda", envname = "foo")
```

#### Using `pip`

You can install `geedim` with `pip`, for example:

``` sh
python -m pip install geedim
```

This shell command assumes you have a Python 3 executable named (or
aliased) as `python` on your PATH, or the command is being called from
within an active Python virtual environment.

### Troubleshooting

If using Python within RStudio, you may need to set your default
interpreter in *Tools* \>\> *Global Optionsâ€¦* \>\> *Python*.

## How {rgeedim} Works

This example shows how to extract a Google Earth Engine asset by name
for an arbitrary extent. The coordinates of the bounding box are
expressed in WGS84 decimal degrees (`"OGC:CRS84"`).

``` r
library(rgeedim)
#> rgeedim v0.2.7 -- using geedim 1.7.2 w/ earthengine-api 0.1.385
```

If this is your first time using any Google Earth Engine tools,
authenticate with `gd_authenticate()`. You can pass arguments to use
several different authorization methods.

Perhaps the easiest to use is `auth_mode="notebook"` since it does not
rely on an existing `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` file nor an
installation of the `gcloud` CLI tools. However, the other options
(using `gcloud` or a service account) are better for non-interactive or
long-term use.

``` r
# short duration token
gd_authenticate(auth_mode = "notebook")
```

``` r
# longer duration (default); requires gcloud command-line tools
gd_authenticate(auth_mode = "gcloud")
```

In each R session you will need to initialize the Earth Engine library.

``` r
gd_initialize()
```

Note that with `auth_mode="gcloud"` you need to specify the project via
`project=` argument, in your default configuration file or via system
environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUOTA_PROJECT`. The authorization
tokens generated for `auth_mode="notebook"` are always associated with a
specific project.

Once initialized you can select an extent of interest. `gd_bbox()` is a
simple function for specifying extents to {rgeedim} functions like
`gd_download()`.

``` r
r <- gd_bbox(
  xmin = -120.6032,
  xmax = -120.5377,
  ymin = 38.0807,
  ymax = 38.1043
)
```

We will download the US NED CHILI (Continuous Heat-Insolation Load
Index)
<https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CSP_ERGo_1_0_US_CHILI>.
We specify an equal-area coordinate reference system (NAD83 Albers),
bilinear resampling, and a resolution of 10 meters.

``` r
x <- 'CSP/ERGo/1_0/US/CHILI' |>
          gd_image_from_id() |>
          gd_download(
            filename = 'image.tif',
            region = r,
            crs = "EPSG:5070",
            resampling = "bilinear",
            scale = 10, # scale=10: request ~10m resolution
            overwrite = TRUE,
            silent = FALSE
          )
```

We can inspect our results with {terra}. The resulting GeoTIFF has two
layers, `"constant"` and `"FILL_MASK"`. The former contains the data,
and the latter contains a mask reflecting data availability (value = 1
where data are available).

``` r
library(terra)
#> terra 1.7.65
f <- rast(x)
f
#> class       : SpatRaster 
#> dimensions  : 402, 618, 2  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)
#> resolution  : 10, 10  (x, y)
#> extent      : -2113880, -2107700, 1945580, 1949600  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
#> coord. ref. : NAD83 / Conus Albers (EPSG:5070) 
#> source      : image.tif 
#> names       : constant, FILL_MASK

plot(f[[1]])
```

## Example: Hillshade from DEM

This example demonstrates the download of a section of the USGS NED
seamless 10m grid. This DEM is processed locally with {terra} to
calculate some terrain derivatives (slope, aspect) and a hillshade.

``` r
library(rgeedim)
library(terra)

gd_initialize()

b <- gd_bbox(
  xmin = -120.296,
  xmax = -120.227,
  ymin = 37.9824,
  ymax = 38.0071
)

## hillshade example
# download 10m NED DEM in AEA
x <- "USGS/3DEP/10m" |>
  gd_image_from_id() |>
  gd_download(
    region = b,
    scale = 10,
    crs = "EPSG:5070",
    resampling = "bilinear",
    filename = "image.tif",
    bands = list("elevation"),
    overwrite = TRUE,
    silent = FALSE
  )
dem <- rast(x)$elevation

# calculate slope, aspect, and hillshade with terra
slp <- terrain(dem, "slope", unit = "radians")
asp <- terrain(dem, "aspect", unit = "radians")
hsd <- shade(slp, asp)

# compare elevation vs. hillshade
plot(c(dem, hillshade = hsd))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-dem10-hillshade-1.jpeg" width="100%" />

Subsets of the `"USGS/3DEP/10m"` image result in multi-band GeoTIFF with
`"elevation"` and `"FILL_MASK"` bands. In the contiguous US we know the
DEM is continuous so the `FILL_MASK` is not that useful. With geedim
\>1.7 we retrieve only the `"elevation"` band by specifying argument
`bands = list("elevation")`. This cuts the raw image size that we need
to download in half.

## Example: LiDAR Slope Map

This example demonstrates how to access 1-meter LiDAR data from the USGS
3D Elevation Program (3DEP).

There are other methods to derive an area of interest from existing
spatial data sources, here we use `gd_region()` on a SpatVector object
and pass resulting object to several functions that require a processing
extent.

LiDAR data are not available everywhere, and are generally available as
collections of (tiled) layers. Therefore we use `gd_search()` to narrow
down the options. The small sample extent covers only one tile.
Additional filters on date and data quality are also possible with
`gd_search()`. A key step in this process is the use of `gd_composite()`
to resample the component images of interest from the collection on the
server-side.

``` r
library(rgeedim)
library(terra)

# search and download from USGS 1m lidar data collection
gd_initialize()

# wkt->SpatVector->GeoJSON
b <- 'POLYGON((-121.355 37.56,-121.355 37.555,
          -121.35 37.555,-121.35 37.56,
          -121.355 37.56))' |>
  vect(crs = "OGC:CRS84")

# create a GeoJSON-like list from a SpatVector object
# (most rgeedim functions arguments for spatial inputs do this automatically)
r <- gd_region(b)

# search collection for an area of interest
a <- "USGS/3DEP/1m" |>
  gd_collection_from_name() |>
  gd_search(region = r) 

# inspect individual image metadata in the collection
gd_properties(a)
#>                                                                        id
#> 1 USGS/3DEP/1m/USGS_1M_10_x64y416_CA_UpperSouthAmerican_Eldorado_2019_B19
#>         date
#> 1 2006-01-01

# resampling images as part of composite; before download
x <- a |>
  gd_composite(resampling = "bilinear") |> 
  gd_download(region = r,
              crs = "EPSG:5070",
              scale = 1,
              filename = "image.tif",
              bands = list("elevation"),
              overwrite = TRUE,
              silent = FALSE) |>
  rast()

# inspect
plot(terra::terrain(x$elevation))
plot(project(b, x), add = TRUE)
```

## Example: Landsat-7 cloud/shadow-free composite

This example demonstrates download of a Landsat-7 cloud/shadow-free
composite image. A collection is created from the NASA/USGS Landsat 7
Level 2, Collection 2, Tier 1.

This example is based on a
[tutorial](https://geedim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/l7_composite.html)
in the `geedim` manual.

``` r
library(rgeedim)
library(terra)

gd_initialize()

b <- gd_bbox(
  xmin = -120.296,
  xmax = -120.227,
  ymin = 37.9824,
  ymax = 38.0071
)

## landsat example
# search collection for date range and minimum data fill (85%)
x <- 'LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2' |>
  gd_collection_from_name() |>
  gd_search(
    start_date = '2020-11-01',
    end_date = '2021-02-28',
    region = b,
    cloudless_portion = 85
  )

# inspect individual image metadata in the collection
gd_properties(x)
#>                                            id       date  fill cloudless grmse
#> 1 LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2/LE07_043034_20201130 2020-11-30 86.41     99.98  4.92
#> 2 LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2/LE07_043034_20210101 2021-01-01 86.85     98.89  4.79
#> 3 LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2/LE07_043034_20210117 2021-01-17 86.05     99.93  5.44
#> 4 LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2/LE07_043034_20210218 2021-02-18 85.66     99.91  5.73

# download a single image, no compositing
y <- gd_properties(x)$id[1] |> 
  gd_image_from_id() |>
  gd_download(
    filename = "image.tif",
    region = b,
    scale = 30,
    crs = 'EPSG:5070',
    dtype = 'uint16',
    overwrite = TRUE,
    silent = FALSE
  )

plot(rast(y)[[1:4]])
```

<img src="man/figures/README-landsat7-composite-1.jpeg" width="100%" />

Now we have several images of interest, and also major issues with some
of the inputs. In this case there were failures of sensors on the
Landsat satellite, but other data gaps may occur due to masked cloudy
areas or due to patchy coverage of the source product.

``` r
# create composite landsat image near December 1st, 2020 and download  
# using q-mosaic method. 
z <- x |> 
  gd_composite(
    method = "q-mosaic",
    date = '2020-12-01'
  ) |>
  gd_download(
    filename = "image.tif",
    region = b,
    scale = 30,
    crs = 'EPSG:5070',
    dtype = 'uint16',
    overwrite = TRUE,
    silent = FALSE
  )

plot(rast(z)[[1:4]])
```

<img src="man/figures/README-landsat7-qmosaic-1.jpeg" width="100%" />

The `"q-mosaic"` method produces a composite (largely) free of artifacts
in this case; this is because it prioritizes pixels with higher distance
from clouds to fill in the gaps. Other methods are available such as
`"medoid"`; this may give better results when compositing more
contrasting inputs such as several dates over a time period where
vegetation or other cover changes appreciably.
